## Stage 1

The screenshot shows that `matroshka.py` encodes the input to a string of smiley faces of same length in different colors. Matching the sample input against the sample output, we can see that the same character would give the same set of colors.

The challenge statement hints about the 8 colors of ANSI Escape Sequences.

The colors are encoded in the following manner:

```text
M -(ASCII binary)-> 0 -(Foreground 0100)-> 0 -(Brightness)-> Dark
                    1                      1 -(Hue #4)-----> Blue
                    0                      0
                    0                      0
                    1 -(Foreground 1101)-> 1 -(Brightness)-> Bright
                    1                      1 -(Hue #5)-----> Magenta
                    0                      0
                    1                      1
```

The theme “Visual Studio Code Default Dark High Contrast“ indicates the palette to parse the colors from.

When decoded, the string will read [`https://matryoshka.sekai.team/-qLf-Aoaur8ZVqK4aFngYg.png`](https://matryoshka.sekai.team/-qLf-Aoaur8ZVqK4aFngYg.png). The image will have a really nice QR code that you should totally scan:

## Stage 2

The `.png` file contains some noisy lines spread across the canvas. Analyzing it, several iDOT blocks can be found, which reveals the file to  be an Apple-specific format.

Open the file with Apple OS (iOS before 14 or macOS before 11, inclusive) to reveal the hidden image. You can do this with [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/):

## Stage 3

With the hint on the picture saying “COVID-19 vaccination” and the `shc:/` header of the text stored in the QR code, we know that this is a [SMART Health](https://smarthealth.cards/) card. Search for _SHC QR code decoder_ online (We used [shc-decode](https://olivercardoza.com/shc-decode/)), and paste the text to receive JSON:

```json
{
    "iss": "https://smarthealthcard.sekai.team/v1/issuer",
    "nbf": 1630850729,
    "vc": {

            "https://smarthealth.cards#covid19",
            "https://smarthealth.cards#immunization",
            "https://smarthealth.cards#health-card"
        ],
        "credentialSubject": {
            "fhirVersion": "4.0.1",
            "fhirBundle": {
                "resourceType": "Bundle",
                "type": "collection",
                "entry": [
                    {
                        "fullUrl": "resource:0",
                        "resource": {
                            "resourceType": "Patient",
                            "name": [
                                {
                                    "family": "CTF",
                                    "given": [
                                        "Project",
                                        "SEKAI"
                                    ]
                                }
                            ],
                            "birthDate": "2020-09-30",
                            "contact": [
                                {
                                    "name": {
                                        "text": "flag"
                                    },
                                    "telecom": [
                                        {
                                            "system": "url",
                                            "value": "data:text/html;base64,PGF1ZGlvIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXRyeW9zaGthLnNla2FpLnRlYW0vOGQ3ODk0MTRhN2M1OGI1ZjU4N2Y4YTA1MGI4ZDc4OGUud2F2IiBjb250cm9scz4="
                                        }
[TRUNCATED]
```

The telecom contact value being `data:text/html;base64,PGF1ZGlvIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXRyeW9zaGthLnNla2FpLnRlYW0vOGQ3ODk0MTRhN2M1OGI1ZjU4N2Y4YTA1MGI4ZDc4OGUud2F2IiBjb250cm9scz4=` seems suspicious. The base64 is decoded into `<audio src="https://matryoshka.sekai.team/8d789414a7c58b5f587f8a050b8d788e.wav" controls>`, which leads us to our next stage.

## Stage 4

When the audio is played, a loud static can be heard with a TTS machine in the background. Opening the file with any audio editor, we can see that the file has 2 channels, with each channel having an almost opposite amplitude with each other. Split the channels into 2 mono audio files, and play them at the same time. The following can be heard clearly:

> upper begin, sierra, echo, kilo, alfa, india, upper finish, open curly bracket, upper kilo, alfa, november, delta, oscar, upper romeo, yankee, oscar, kilo, oscar, five, upper foxtrot, india, victor, echo, two, upper tango, whiskey, oscar, fower, upper foxtrot, oscar, uniform, romeo, close curly bracket

Decode from the NATO phonetic alphabet:

Flag: `SEKAI{KandoRyoko5Five2Two4Four}`

### Trivia

- The initial string from Stage 1, `j+2gBJZ@a]TAtL$j+)[CVh*lZVrN;Xj+F>kK<sTjLZ=#Qj+G#5]UoN<$`, decodes to `あなたと　私で　ランデブー？\n\n` (Rōmaji: "Anata to watashi de randebū?"; English: "You and me, rendezvous?") with Base85.
- The smiley face mark in Stage 1 was chosen as it makes a significant appearance in the music video of [マトリョシカ (MATORYOSHKA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOz-9FzIDf0) by ハチ (HACHI).
- `KandoRyoko5Five2Two4Four` is rōmaji for `感度良好 524`, which is a lyric in MATORYOSHKA.
